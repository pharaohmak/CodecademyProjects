# Portfolio Website

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

Build the Contact Page

The contact page includes your email address, as well as any other relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

Build the Home Page

The home page will be the main page that users visit. It should prominently feature your name, along with a selection of several projects that you are most proud of. Each project should have a picture, a summary of the project, and the technology used to build it.

Version control

Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

Create files and deploy it Locally

On your computer, create a directory to hold your files and create each file. Deploy your code locally to see what it looks like in the browser.

Wireframe your website

Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft what you’d like your portfolio to look like.

Plan your project

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

Publish to the web

Take what you’ve built and use GitHub pages to share with the world.

Make it responsive

Use responsive design to ensure that your page is viewable on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Style the content

Now that you have your content, consider how you would like it to look. Do you want to arrange your projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical arrangement? What colors do you want to use to personalize the page?

Next Steps

Congratulations on building your own portfolio! You’re welcome to expand your portfolio beyond these two pages. For example, you can include a page for each project that you’ve built.
