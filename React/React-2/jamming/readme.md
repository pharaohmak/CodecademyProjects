Jammming
In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

We’ve broken the Jammming project into 13 sections. Each section contains a descriptive header with an introductory step followed by a set of steps that guide you to the outcome. The first step of each section will explain the goal and provide a brief overview of how we’ll accomplish it. Before you start the second step, try to plan how you would complete the section. As you finish the rest of the steps, reflect on how your solution compares to ours.
