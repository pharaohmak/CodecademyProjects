Combinator
Use a CSS combinator to make a ruleset more specific.

Instructions
1.
In the browser, the elements that have a class attribute of .recipe are bolded. In style.css, change the .recipe ruleset to only select the .recipe element nested within the <article> element.


Hint
You can use a combinator to select children or siblings of elements. In this case, you want to target a child element of <article> that has a class attribute of .recipe.
