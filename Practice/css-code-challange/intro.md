Welcome to the CSS Code Challenges
In this CSS code challenge, you will complete challenges based on CSS concepts in our Learn CSS lesson. The best way to reinforce these new skills is through practice. Weâ€™ve created a series of problems designed to use your new CSS knowledge.

As you complete these challenges, we encourage you to review past lessons, look things up in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) CSS documentation. Check out the hints and solution code if you get stuck, and, most of all, have fun!
